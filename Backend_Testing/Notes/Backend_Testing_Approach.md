# Backend Testing Approach

- Identify key business entities (users, products, orders).
- Write SQL queries to validate data after UI/API actions.
- Compare expected vs actual data values.
- Check for data integrity issues using joins and constraints.


Note: The backend database includes 100+ synthetic users (including Parth) to support realistic test data volume.
