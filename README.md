# End-to-End QA Project – E-Commerce System (UI, API & Backend)

This repository contains a full-fledged QA project for an e-commerce system, focusing on:

- Manual UI testing (OpenCart demo)
- API testing (public e-commerce-style APIs using Postman)

It is structured to resemble how a real QA project is managed in industry, with clear separation for:
- Test planning
- UI test design & execution
- API test design & execution
- Backend validation
- Bug tracking
- Test reports & metrics
